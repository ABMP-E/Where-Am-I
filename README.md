### The Motivation Behind This Project

This fast-paced world of urbanization, where the Indigenous Territories are occupied by the public at an alarming rate, presents us with a challenge to identify their regions as well as spread awareness among the community to protect Indigenous Territory. Where Am I App allows the entire community, from the Indigenous to amateurs who want to have fun, to take part in the conservation process. We further gamify the experience to make it fun and thrilling. To earn points users can add location markers and additional information on an interactive map. Scores of top users will be displayed on a leaderboard.

### How to Use The Application

###### Login Page
Located on the Login page are text fields to fill in your username and password. Alternatively, existing users who had signed-up using their Google, Facebook or LinkedIn accounts can simply login by clicking on one of the buttons. New users can click the sign-up button to navigate to the Sign-Up Page. 

###### Sign Up Page
On the Sign Up Page, there are five text fields (i.e. Full Name, Username, Email Address, Password and Confirm Password), to obtain the user’s information and set their password up. Alternatively, a user can sign up with your Google, Facebook or LinkedIn account using the buttons underneath. 

###### Dashboard
After logging in or signing up, the user is directed to the Application’s Dashboard Page containing a map displaying all Indigenous territories that have been moderated by our users. Each pointer on the map directs you to the Territory Info Page. On the top left of the Dashboard Page, you can click the trophy icon to access the LeaderBoard Page. Besides, on the top right of the Dashboard Page, there is a profile icon that can direct you to your profile. Furthermore, upon clicking the “Add New Pointer” button, you are able to add a new location & stories & go to a moderator.

###### Add-Info Page
After you select the picture of the Indigenous territory that you have found on the Gallery Page, you will be directed to the AddInfo Page. You should indicate what the name and location of the Indigenous territory are, as well as add stories, laws and histories of the land. As a result, the users are able to submit the information and go to a moderator for the territory. 

###### Profile Page
On the Profile Page, you are able to see your personal information (i.e. FullName, Username, Email Address and Password). By default, the password is hidden; to view the password, the user can click on the eye-slash icon. The users can also view their total points, number of followers and the number of users whom they follow. Moreover, upon clicking the “note” icon beside the profile icon, you will be directed to the UserHistory Page. 

###### UserHistory Page
On the page, you will find the users’ most recent 4 records of how they have earned their points. 

###### LeaderBoard Page
On the page, you will find the top 5 users, having the highest number of points. Users are able to earn points by submitting a new location of Indigenous Territory, go to a moderator and share stories.  

###### Law & History Page
On the page, the users will find the law and history of the Indigenous territory. 

###### Story Page
On the page, the users can find various stories of the Indigenous territory. 

###### AddStory Page
On the page, the users can add the images and stories they know about the Indigenous territory.

### Challenges We Encountered

All of us are new to application designing and we faced a little, if not huge, challenge in doing so. Firstly, none of us had any experience in App Development and were not able to make our app realistic; therefore, we chose to use Figma to create our application prototype which can present our ideas in a delicate fashion. Along with Figma, we also used Flask. Furthermore, deciding rewards for users, which are not only worth earning for the users but also not expensive items considering they come under a Non-Profit Organization, was a really difficult task.

### Our Proud Accomplishments

Our team is most proud that despite not having all the skills necessary to implement every aspect of our idea and an actual app, we still succeeded in creating a model app that is really easy to navigate and has interactive functions. We created an inclusive atmosphere on our app, which will encourage users to gain more knowledge of the Indigenous Territory. This probably inspires users to protect the Indigenous Territory and people there. We are proud to have integrated systems like rewarding and competing in a game fashion. Planning out the UX design of the app and the whole system of the game was an essential first step for this project as this will encourage users to find and learn the basic Indigenous land while enjoying the game.

### What We've Learned

From this Hackathon, we surely gained immense knowledge. We have learnt a lot of new things around us, aka Indigenous Territory. Furthermore, it was a great opportunity to provide us with new coding experiences and UI design (e.g. Figma), which shall definitely help us in the future. Moreover, as a virtual team, we have learned how to collaborate remotely and communicate effectively.

### Future Project Extensions

It is worthwhile to note that we have created just a medium-to-high fidelity prototype, as of now, but are looking forward to implementing our plans into the final fully functional application which would be available to download for free from Apple App Store and Google Play Store. 

Our application shall be including alt-text on all pictures, completely screen reader-friendly and easily maneuverable by a keyboard. Apart from that, we will allow the user to personalize their colours and themes which fit the needs of every specific individual. People who are unable to read, or tend to learn more by listening more can simply hear the recorded version of each application page and follow along with the application’s content. Additionally, our app shall always be open to feedback from users, and we strive to constantly update and improve the accessibility/inclusivity of Where Am I.
